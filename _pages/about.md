Hi there, thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹

I currently work at [Slalom](https://www.slalom.com/ca) where I offer consulting services on DevOps and Cloud enablement for businesses.

Here is what I excel at:

â€£ Setting up and managing enterprise-scale cloud environments on `AWS`, `Azure` and `GCP` using Infrastructure as Code tools like `Terraform`.

â€£ Designing CI/CD flows on `GitHub Actions` using `GitOps` as a driving principle.

â€£ Building containerized applications and cluster management on `Kubernetes` and `Podman`.

â€£ Creating automation using `Python scripting` and `Ansible`.

â€£ Systems administration: a bit of a `Linux` fanatic.

If this resonates with you, you can find my contact info below ðŸ‘‡
