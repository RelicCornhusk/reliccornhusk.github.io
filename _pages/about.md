Hi there, thanks for stopping by 👋

I currently work at [Slalom](https://www.slalom.com/ca) where I offer consulting services on DevOps and Cloud enablement for businesses.

Here is what I excel at:

‣ Setting up and managing enterprise-scale cloud environments on `AWS`, `Azure` and `GCP` using Infrastructure as Code tools like `Terraform` ☁️

‣ Designing CI/CD flows on `GitHub Actions` using `GitOps` as a driving principle 🚀

‣ Building containerized applications and cluster management on `Kubernetes`, `Docker` and `Podman` 🚢

‣ Automating workloads using `Python`, `Bash` and `Ansible` 🧑🏽‍💻

‣ SysAdmin: I'm a bit of a `Linux` fanatic and a `networking` nerd 🐧

If this resonates with you, you can find my contact info below 👇
